# socialNetworkSite
This is the project I'm working on right now. It is a social media site similar with Facebook, where users can create an account and interact with each other by messaging or sharing clips and pictures. Itâ€™s almost done, but I need to fix a few more bugs before it is available for everyone. I used PHP, mySql, JavaScript, jQury, html, css, and so much more.
